# optic
`optic` is a repository for OSC based computer vision and depth camera interaction, written by Rama Gottfried (<a href="http://ramagottfried.com">me</a>).

The development is in connection with a new performance piece for video and microbiology inspired puppetry (<a href="https://vimeo.com/133111367">demo</a>), and for the  <a href="http://zlabucb.blogspot.com/2015/05/digital-intermedia-collaborative.html">Digital Intermedia Collaborative Platform</a>, a software and hardware system that aims to provide artists and researchers an optimized motion sensing system for performance and experimentation for users of all levels of technical experience.

Coordinated by UC Berkeley's Center for New Music and Audio Technologies (<a href="http://cnmat.berkeley.edu">CNMAT</a>) and <a href="http://zlabucb.blogspot.com/">Z-Lab</a>, the project will provide plug-and-play access to streaming OSC data describing gesture and light movements using an array of 2D and 3D cameras with dedicated data parsing servers running OpenCV, Microsoft Kinect, and Intel Realsense APIs. Once completed, the platform will provide a knowable and reliable system that may be easily assembled at other institutions.
